  <p style="color:white;"> Since these are only names of animes I love, I'll give a bit of background info on the S rank ones.<br> Tokyo Ghoul: A college student is attacked by a ghoul, a being that feeds on human flesh. He later receives an organ transplant from the ghoul, becoming part monster himself.<br> Attack on Titans: After his hometown is destroyed and his mother is killed, young Eren Jaeger vows to cleanse the earth of the giant humanoid Titans that have brought humanity to the brink of extinction. Humans are nearly exterminated by giant creatures called Titans.<br> Demon Slayer: A family is attacked by demons and only two members survive - Tanjiro and his sister Nezuko, who is turning into a demon slowly. Tanjiro sets out to become a demon slayer to avenge his family and cure his sister.<br> Black Clover: It follows the first adventures of Asta and the Black Bulls in the Clover Kingdom. After Asta receives a grimoire and joins the Black Bulls to become the new Wizard King, he explores a dungeon and meets Mars, a magic knight from the Diamond Kingdom.<br> Fire Force: A mysterious phenomenon stripped the humanity of the right to have a quiet life, with hopes and dreams. This plague is known as Spontaneous Human Combustion and turns people randomly into mindless creatures known as Infernals, which is the fate worse than death and causes one sufferings unimaginable.</p>
